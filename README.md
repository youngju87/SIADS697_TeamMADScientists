# Socioeconomic Segregation in the Detroit Public Schools Community District (DPSCD)

Detroit Public Schools Community District (DPSCD) is made up of 107 schools and over 48,000 students. The enormity of the school district and the diversity within it leaves us believing that socioeconomic segregation may be prevalent between the school boundaries in the DPSCD. In this study we explored four different data sets to compare the schools within 27 different zip code areas that create DPSCD. The data that was explored includes test score data from the DPSCD open data files, small area income and poverty estimates (SAIPE) from the US census bureau which contains Per pupil Expenditure (PPE), GIS open data on school district boundaries within the state of Michigan and USA census tract areas on median household income.


## Motivation

We believe segregation still exists in schools today. There has been extensive research on how income differences across schools correlates to an inequality in socioeconomic resources available which includes Reardon, 2014 - “Income inequality affects our children’s educational opportunities”, Papay et. al., 2015 - “Income-Based Inequality in Educational Outcomes”, Owens, 2018 - “Income Segregation between School Districts and Inequality in Students’ Achievement”, Monarrez, 2018 - “Do New York City’s school attendance boundaries encourage racial and ethnic segregation?” and Broer et.al., 2019 “Socioeconomic Inequality and Educational Outcomes: An Introduction”.  We hope to explore whether or not school district boundaries are a contributing factor to socioeconomic segregation in the Detroit area. We wanted to focus on Detroit because none of the members of our group are from the area, but we are all attending a Michigan college. Other questions we hope to investigate are: what range of income does this segregation affect most, if any? And what age group is most affected by district boundaries, if any?
